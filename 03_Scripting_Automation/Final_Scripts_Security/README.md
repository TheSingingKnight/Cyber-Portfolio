# ðŸ’» Final Scripts: Polished Security Automation Tools

This directory is reserved for completed, polished Python and Bash scripts designed to solve specific security problems. These scripts demonstrate practical application of skills in data parsing, file manipulation, and automationâ€”core competencies for a Security Operations Center (SOC) role.

Projects listed here are designed to be production-ready and include comprehensive documentation.

## Showcase Projects

| Project Title | Goal | Key Skills Demonstrated | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log Ingestion & Parsing Tool** | A Python script that reads raw security logs (CSV/JSON/XML), extracts key fields (IPs, timestamps), and outputs clean, structured data for analysis. | Python, File I/O, **Regex**, **CSV/JSON/XML Parsing**, Error Handling | Planning |
| **Simple System Health Check** | A Bash script to automatically check the security configuration (e.g., firewall status, services running) of a Linux host and report the findings. | Bash Scripting, Linux Commands, Automation, File Output | Planning |
| **Threat Intelligence IP Checker** | A Python script that takes a list of IP addresses from a security alert and checks them against a public threat intelligence feed (via API). | Python, API Interaction, **Dictionaries**, List Comprehension | Planning |
| **Simple Hash Analyzer** | A Python script that reads a text file of plaintext passwords, generates the SHA256 hash for each, and outputs the result, demonstrating simple cryptographic concepts. | Python, **Hashing (`hashlib`)**, File I/O, Basic Cryptography Concepts | Planning |
