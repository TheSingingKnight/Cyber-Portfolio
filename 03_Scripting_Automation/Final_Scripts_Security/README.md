# 🛡️ Foundational Scripts & Utilities

<br>
Welcome to the "Production Ready" zone of my scripting journey. 
<br><br>
This directory is reserved for polished Python and Bash utilities designed to solve specific security problems. These scripts demonstrate the practical application of core competencies—data parsing, file manipulation, and automation—essential for a <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC)</strong> role.

## 🛠️ The Quality Standard
In line with my **"Measure Four Times and Cut Once"** philosophy, every project listed here adheres to the following standards:
* **Production-Ready:** Clean code that handles errors gracefully.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear instructions on how to run and interpret the output.
* **Logic-First:** Prioritising sound logical structure over unnecessary complexity.

## 📂 Showcase Projects

| Project Title | Goal | Key Skills Demonstrated | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log Ingestion & Parsing Tool** | A Python script that extracts key fields (IPs, timestamps) from raw logs and outputs structured data. | Python, File I/O, Regex, Error Handling. | **Planned: Late March 2026** |

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
As my development roadmap expands, the following utilities are slated for production:
* **Simple System Health Check:** A Bash script to audit security configurations (firewall, services) on a Linux host.
* **Simple Hash Analyzer:** A script that generates SHA256 hashes for files to demonstrate cryptographic integrity using the `hashlib` library.
* **Threat Intelligence IP Checker:** Integrating public threat feeds via API interaction.
* **Automated Log Scheduler:** Implementing task scheduling for recurring security audits.

**Current Status:** Focused on core Python revision (Chapters 1–5). Late March 2026 is dedicated to the development of the Log Ingestion & Parsing Tool as a primary foundational utility.
