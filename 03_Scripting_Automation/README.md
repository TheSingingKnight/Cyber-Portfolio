# 🐍 Pillar 3: Scripting & Automation

<br>
Welcome to the scripting hub of my portfolio.
<br><br>

This section is structured to demonstrate my **methodical approach** to technical development and the **practical utility** of my work in Python.

## 📂 Project Tracks

### 🏛️ [Learning Python Journey](./Learning_Python_Journey)
A granular record of my foundational steps into Python development.
<br>
These modules showcase:
* **Core Logic:** Mastering syntax, flow control, and data structures.
* **Methodical Growth:** A step-by-step documentation of the "Measure Four Times" learning process.
* **Technical Discipline:** Demonstrating the commitment required to transition into a new technical language.

### 🛡️ [Foundational Scripts & Utilities](./Final_Scripts_Security)
Simple, functional tools built to solve specific tasks using core Python logic.
<br>
These projects focus on:
* **Practical Utility:** Initial tools developed for basic data parsing and reconnaissance.
* **Code Integrity:** Clean, commented code that prioritises readability and basic error handling.
* **Logic over Complexity:** Demonstrating that a sturdy foundational base leads to reliable technical output.

**Current Status:** Active revision of foundational modules. March 2026 is designated for a "Methodical Maintenance" track, re-establishing core logic alongside primary security lab work.
