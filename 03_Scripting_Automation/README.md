# üêç Scripting & Automation: Efficiency and Tool Development

This section showcases my ability to use scripting languages like Python and Bash to automate repetitive security tasks, parse data, and develop simple command-line tools. Scripting is a vital skill for increasing efficiency in any SOC or security engineering role.

## Project Directories

This pillar is organized into the following areas:

| Directory | Purpose | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Scripts** | Polished, production-ready security tools with comprehensive documentation. | [Final Scripts Security](Final_Scripts_Security) |
| **Learning Journal** | A chronological record of foundational coding progress and exercises. | [Learning Journal Python](Learning_Journal_Python) |

## High-Value Projects Showcase

Projects listed here are designed to be high-impact, security-focused tools that will eventually be promoted to the **Final Scripts** directory once complete.

| Project Title | Focus | Status | Expected Skills/Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log File Parser (CSV)** | Writing a Python script to ingest a raw security log file and output key data into a readable format. | Planning | Python, CSV Module, File I/O, Error Handling |
| **Automated System Check (Bash)** | Using a Bash script to perform basic health and security configuration checks on a Linux system. | Planning | Bash Scripting, Linux Commands, Cron Jobs |
