# üêç Scripting & Automation: Efficiency and Tool Development

This section showcases my ability to use scripting languages like Python and Bash to automate repetitive security tasks, parse data, and develop simple command-line tools. Scripting is a vital skill for increasing efficiency in any SOC or security engineering role.

## Project Directories

This pillar is organized into the following areas:

| Directory | Purpose | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Scripts** | Polished, production-ready security tools with comprehensive documentation. | [Final Scripts Security](Final_Scripts_Security) |
| **Learning Journal** | A chronological record of foundational coding progress and exercises. | [Learning Journal Python](Learning_Journal_Python) |

## High-Value Projects Showcase

Projects listed here are designed to be high-impact, security-focused tools that will eventually be promoted to the **Final Scripts** directory once complete.

| Project Title | Focus | Status | Expected Skills/Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log Ingestion & Parsing Tool** | A Python script that reads raw security logs, extracts key fields, and outputs clean, structured data for analysis. | Planning | Python, File I/O, **Regex**, **CSV/JSON/XML Parsing** |
| **Simple Hash Analyzer** | A Python script that reads a text file of plaintext passwords, generates the SHA256 hash for each, demonstrating cryptographic concepts. | Planning | Python, **Hashing (`hashlib`)**, File I/O, Basic Cryptography |
| **Threat Intelligence IP Checker** | A Python script that takes a list of IPs from a security alert and checks them against a public threat intelligence feed (via API). | Planning | Python, API Interaction, Dictionaries, List Comprehension |
| **Automated System Check (Bash)** | Using a Bash script to perform basic health and security configuration checks on a Linux system. | Planning | Bash Scripting, Linux Commands, Automation, Cron Jobs |
