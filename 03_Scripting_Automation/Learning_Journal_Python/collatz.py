Focus: Demonstrating function definition, parameter passing, return values,
       and robust error handling.

Demonstrates:
- Call Stack: Functions calling other functions (main -> input check -> collatz).
- While loops for continuous and conditional iteration.
- try/except block for graceful error handling (ValueError).
- The 'global' keyword for variable scope management.
- Optional print parameters (end) for custom output formatting.
- for i in range() for controlled iteration.

Welcome to the Collatz Sequence Script!

The Collatz Sequence is a famous mathematical problem.

Starting with any positive number, the sequence does one of two calculations.
Depending whether the number is even or odd.

If even, the number is divided by 2.
If odd, the number is timesed by 3 with 1 added at the end.

This repeats until the final number reaches 1.

Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer; sooner or later, youâ€™ll arrive at 1.
Even mathematicians arenâ€™t sure why!

With this script you can test out any number and see the process play out.
