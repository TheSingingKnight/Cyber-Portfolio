# Cyber-Portfolio: Security Operations & Analytics

Welcome to my professional portfolio, where I showcase my hands-on technical skills and commitment to mastering cybersecurity concepts.

My expertise is formally validated by **completing the CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway**, earning the **advanced** titles:
* **CompTIA Network Security Professional (CNSP)**
* **CompTIA Security Analytics Professional (CSAP)**

This foundation covers the core domains of **A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+, and PenTest+** and demonstrates a mastery of the end-to-end security lifecycle.

My goal is to apply this structured knowledge in a hands-on role within **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysis** or general Information Security. This repository serves as a **living record of my professional growth, demonstrating continuous skill development and application** throughout my career.
