# 🛡️ Pillar 1: Defensive Operations

<br>
Welcome to the defensive operations hub.
<br><br>
This section focuses on core <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC)</strong> skills, demonstrating my ability to use industry-standard tools for monitoring, analysis, and structured incident response. 

<br>The projects below showcase the practical application of defensive principles, directly mapping to the knowledge validated by my **CompTIA CySA+** and **Security+** certifications.

## 🏛️ The Defensive Strategy
In line with my **"Measure Four Times and Cut Once"** philosophy, I prioritise the following in every lab:
* **Visibility:** Ensuring full log coverage and clear data ingestion.
* **Accuracy:** Reducing false positives through refined alerting rules.
* **Methodical Analysis:** Following structured triage processes (e.g., NIST/SANS) to document and mitigate threats.

<br>

## 📂 Showcase Projects (March 2026 "Truth Lab")

| Project Title | Focus | Status | Expected Skills/Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Splunk SIEM Ingestion & Triage** | Deploying a home-lab SIEM and performing structured analysis on ingested security events. | **Planned: March 2026** | Splunk (SIEM), VirtualBox, Sysmon, Incident Triage. |
| **Vulnerability Management (Nessus)** | Performing credentialed and non-credentialed scans on a lab network to identify and risk-score vulnerabilities. | **Planned: March 2026** | Nessus Essentials, Risk Assessment, CVSS Scoring. |

<br>

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
The following labs are slated for development following the completion of the March baseline sprint:
* **Network Traffic Analysis (PCAP):** Deep-dive inspection of network traces to identify anomalies and signs of data exfiltration using **Wireshark**.
* **Linux Host Hardening:** Applying secure configuration baselines (UFW/SSH hardening) to a Linux host.
* **IOC Scanning & Threat Intel:** Automating the checking of hashes and IPs against public feeds via Python utilities.
* **Wazuh SIEM/XDR Exploration:** Secondary SIEM deployment for comparative analysis of XDR features.

**Current Status:** Focused on high-stakes operatic contract completion. March 2026 is designated for the primary Splunk and Nessus lab deployments to strengthen the "Practical Gap" in defensive operations.
