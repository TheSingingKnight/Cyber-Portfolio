# 🛡️ Defensive Operations: Threat Detection and Triage

This section focuses on core **Security Operations Center (SOC)** skills, demonstrating my ability to use security tools for monitoring, analysis, and structured incident response.

The projects below showcase practical application of defensive principles, directly mapping to the knowledge validated by CompTIA CySA+ and Security+ certification domains.
