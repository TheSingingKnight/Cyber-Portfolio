# üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Operations: Threat Detection and Triage

This section focuses on core **Security Operations Center (SOC)** skills, demonstrating my ability to use security tools for monitoring, analysis, and structured incident response.

The projects below showcase practical application of defensive principles, directly mapping to the knowledge validated by CompTIA CySA+ and Security+ certification domains.

## Projects

| Project Title | Focus | Status | Expected Skills/Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wazuh SIEM Deployment & Alert Triage** | Deploying an open-source SIEM/XDR platform and performing structured analysis on simulated security events. | **In Progress** | **Wazuh (SIEM/XDR)**, VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Incident Triage |
| **Network Traffic Analysis (PCAP)** | Deep-dive inspection of a pre-captured network trace to identify protocols, anomalies, and signs of data exfiltration. | Planning | **Wireshark**, Protocol Analysis, TCP/IP Fundamentals, Flow Data |
| **Linux Host Hardening & Baseline** | Applying security best practices (e.g., firewall rules, secure SSH) to a Linux host and establishing a secure configuration baseline. | Planning | **Linux CLI (iptables/ufw)**, SSH, Principle of Least Privilege |
| **IOC Scanning & Threat Intel** | Automating the checking of file hashes and IP addresses against public **Threat Intelligence Feeds** (e.g., VirusTotal/OTX). | Planning | **Python Scripting**, API Interaction, OSINT, IOCs |
